# PlagueGame


Hi, this is an upload of my old game made for one of my classes. It's pretty amatourish and many mistakes were made while creating it, but I learned a lot of what (not :p) to do while coding it, so it's nice to see what I progressed from.


The game includes a simple mechanic of a 'virus' spreading around different regions of the world and effectively reducing their population. Progress made by the disease depends on statictics such as healthcare quality of a region or travel routes attached to it. Player can fight back by enacting policies in each region, such as quarantines, incerased healthcare funding. Everything is limited by two main resources being: public approval and money. Player's goal is to survive as long as they can, by balancing resources and trying to outlive the virus. 






### View of the game's GUI: 

Player switches to a region by clicking on it on the map. Log of the main world events is held on the right, while most of the informative statistics regarding the chosen region are displayed on the left.

#### Things I practiced while doing it:
- Threads in Java
- Data oriented programming (I mostly tried iterating trough regions' data instead of loading too many objects and calling their methods)
- Using Swing library and its various components
- Integration of separate in-game mechanics and parallel use of data/objects by different threads.
